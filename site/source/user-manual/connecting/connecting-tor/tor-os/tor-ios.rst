==================
Running Tor on iOS
==================

As of March 2022, Orbot is now available on iOS!!

#. Navigate to the app store, and download `Orbot <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/orbot/id1609461599>`_

#. Open the app and press on the Onion to connect to Tor

.. note:: This version of Orbot, unlike Android, will proxy ALL of your phone's traffic across Tor.  You may want to disconnect for routine web browsing, etc, and connect for use with Embassy services.
